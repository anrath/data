Apply performance best practices to this code:

- Optimize time/space complexity; prefer efficient algorithms and data structures
- Eliminate redundant computations; memoize expensive operations
- Minimize re-renders: use proper dependencies, avoid inline object/function creation in render paths
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components and code splitting for large bundles
- Cache appropriately: HTTP caching, in-memory caching, query result caching
- Prevent memory leaks: clean up subscriptions, timers, and event listeners
- Batch operations and debounce/throttle frequent events
- Profile before optimizing; avoid premature optimization
