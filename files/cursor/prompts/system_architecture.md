Apply architecture best practices to this code:

- Use clear, descriptive names that reveal intent (variables, functions, files)
- Separate concerns: single responsibility per module/component
- Document public APIs with purpose, parameters, and return values
- Keep functions small and focused; extract complex logic into named helpers
- Prefer composition over inheritance; favor explicit over implicit
- Minimize coupling; define clear interfaces between modules
- Follow established patterns consistently throughout the codebase
- Design for testability: pure functions, dependency injection where needed
- Structure code for easy navigation: logical file organization, co-located tests
